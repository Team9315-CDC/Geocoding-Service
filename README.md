Git repository for Junior Design Project

## Building
 Our project uses Gradle 6.2.2 as a build tool.
 
 
Use

`gradle build` 

in the Geocoding-Service/ folder to build the source files located in `src/main/java`.

## Running

Use
    

`gradle run`


This calls ``java main.Java.Server``

## Cleaning

Use

``gradle clean``

which will remove the `build/` directory.
